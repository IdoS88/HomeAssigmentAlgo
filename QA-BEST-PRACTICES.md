# QA Best Practices for Ride Assignment Algorithm

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Test Early, Test Often** - Write tests alongside code, not after
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation** - Focus on what the code does, not how
- **Fail Fast, Fail Clear** - Tests should fail quickly with clear error messages
- **Maintain Test Independence** - Each test should be able to run in isolation
- **Test Edge Cases** - Cover boundary conditions and error scenarios

## 📋 Test Structure Standards

### 1. Test Naming Convention
Use the **GIVEN-WHEN-THEN** pattern for clear, descriptive test names:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD
test('GIVEN driver with 06:00-12:00 shift AND ride at 06:30-07:00 WHEN assigning THEN should assign successfully', async () => {

// ❌ BAD
test('should assign ride', async () => {
```

### 2. AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
Structure every test with clear sections:

```typescript
test('GIVEN valid data WHEN processing THEN should succeed', async () => {
  // Arrange - Set up test data and expectations
  const strategy = new GreedyStrategy();
  const drivers = createTestDrivers();
  const rides = createTestRides();

  // Act - Execute the code under test
  const assignments = await strategy.assign(rides, drivers);

  // Assert - Verify the results
  assert.strictEqual(assignments.length, 1, 'Should assign exactly one ride');
  assert.strictEqual(assignments[0]!.driver.id, 'driver1', 'Should assign to correct driver');
});
```

### 3. Test Organization
Group related tests using nested `describe` blocks:

```typescript
describe('Shift Availability - Driver Assignment Logic', () => {
  describe('Happy Path Scenarios', () => {
    // Success cases
  });
  
  describe('Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions', () => {
    // Boundary testing
  });
  
  describe('Error Conditions and Negative Cases', () => {
    // Failure scenarios
  });
  
  describe('Performance and Load Testing', () => {
    // Performance tests
  });
});
```

## 🧪 Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **Scope**: Single function, class, or module
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies
- **Speed**: Fast execution (< 100ms per test)

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Test interaction between multiple components
- **Scope**: Multiple modules working together
- **Mocking**: Minimal mocking, use real data
- **Speed**: Medium execution (< 1s per test)

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows
- **Scope**: Entire system from input to output
- **Mocking**: No mocking, use real external services
- **Speed**: Slower execution (< 10s per test)

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify system performance under load
- **Scope**: Large datasets, stress testing
- **Mocking**: Use realistic data volumes
- **Speed**: Variable, with timeout limits

## 📊 Test Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ line coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 80%+ path coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage (ride assignment logic)

### Coverage Areas
- ✅ **Happy Path**: Normal successful scenarios
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, empty inputs
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs, system failures
- ✅ **Performance**: Large datasets, timeout scenarios
- ✅ **Security**: Input validation, data sanitization

## 🔍 Test Data Management

### 1. Test Data Factories
Use factory functions for consistent test data:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Reusable factory
const driver = TestDataFactory.createDriver('driver1', { 
  fuelCost: 2.0, 
  shifts: [{ start: "06:00", end: "12:00" }] 
});

// ❌ BAD - Inline data
const driver = {
  driverId: "driver1",
  firstName: "John",
  // ... 20 more fields
};
```

### 2. Test Data Isolation
- Each test should use unique data
- Clean up after each test
- Avoid shared mutable state

### 3. Realistic Test Data
- Use data that reflects real-world scenarios
- Include edge cases in test datasets
- Test with various data sizes

## ⚡ Performance Testing Standards

### 1. Performance Benchmarks
```typescript
test('GIVEN large dataset WHEN processing THEN should complete within time limit', async () => {
  const { result, duration } = await PerformanceTestHelpers.measureTime(async () => {
    return await strategy.assign(rides, drivers);
  });

  assert(duration < 5000, `Should complete within 5 seconds, took ${duration}ms`);
  assert(result.length > 0, 'Should process some assignments');
});
```

### 2. Load Testing
- Test with increasing data volumes
- Measure memory usage
- Monitor for memory leaks
- Set appropriate timeouts

## 🚨 Error Testing Standards

### 1. Exception Testing
```typescript
test('GIVEN invalid input WHEN processing THEN should throw appropriate error', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const invalidData = null;

  // Act & Assert
  await assert.rejects(
    () => parseDrivers(invalidData),
    {
      name: 'ZodError',
      message: /Expected array/
    },
    'Should throw ZodError for invalid input'
  );
});
```

### 2. Error Message Validation
- Test that error messages are helpful
- Verify error codes are consistent
- Ensure errors include context

## 📝 Test Documentation

### 1. Test Comments
```typescript
test('GIVEN driver with shift AND ride outside shift WHEN assigning THEN should reject', async () => {
  // This test verifies that the shift validation logic correctly
  // prevents assignment of rides that fall outside driver availability windows
  // It's critical for ensuring drivers only work during their scheduled shifts
});
```

### 2. Test Descriptions
- Explain the business logic being tested
- Include expected behavior
- Mention any special conditions

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks
- Run tests before commit
- Check code coverage
- Validate test quality

### 2. CI Pipeline
